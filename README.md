# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.  
The Grocery Tracking project was created to provide an output of the frequency a specific item occurs, a list of every item and it's occurence frequency, or a histogram of every item and it's occurence count along with a .dat file, all based on information from an input text file and the users input choice from the three.  The project was to learn fluidity between Python and C++ programming languages, but it was also used to eliminate the need of a user to count each item manually by providing the requested information as needed.

What did you do particularly well?  
I believe I did particularly well at providing informative comments for other developers to understand what each section of the code is doing.  I also provided clean formatting of text outputs for the user interface, and made sure to change the text color from white to blue for the histogram, while remembering to change the text color back to white afterwards.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?  
I believe that I could have done a better job of formatting the histogram if I left aligned the names of each word and dynamically chose the format width based on the longest item's length, but I wasn't sure how to do it at the time.  This is something I would like to do in future projects to produce more clean outputs.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?  
The most challenging portion of this project to write was reading the frequency.dat file for the histogram.  I am very familiar with how to read and write files in Python, but since C++ is a much newer language for me in reference to experience, I had to utilized both previous zyBooks modules and stackoverflow to complete that portion.  I use stackoverflow.com quite often when I run into issues no matter what language I am working in because it is a useful community driven forum with a lot of the same issues posted that we as developers may have already asked.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?  
Now that I have a better understanding of integrating multiple programming languages into one project, I will be able to combine the knowledge I have with the knowledge of other developers if they are more fluent in some other programming language.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?  
I made this project maintainable by creating functions for each major portion of the project so that no piece needed to be written multiple times when a single function call for each would suffice.  I also made it readable by appropriately naming variables and functions, as well as providing other developers easy to understand comments for each section of the project.  It is adaptable because some of the wrapper functions are not specific to any particular function pull in Python, and it can be used for multiple functions that use similar inputs and outputs.
